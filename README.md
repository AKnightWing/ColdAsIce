## Abstract
In this text, we develop implement a Monte Carlo algorithm to study thermodynamic properties of ice. Our program, written in Python, is open-sourced. We consider a rudimentary 2 dimensional lattice model of ice and compute its entropy as a function of lattice size at absolute zero. A model of energetic ice is also considered and its thermodynamic properties are studied with temperature. We report a remarkable result for the energetic ice model, the presence of a phase transition at non zero temperatures.

This project is part of a submission for the course PHY 312: Numerical Methods, IISER Bhopal, Fall 2020.
